\title{Ancient History Final Review}
\author{Christopher Milan}

\begin{document}

\section{General information}
\subsection{Format}
\subsubsection{Short answers (2 questions of 15 points each)}
You will be asked to answer two questions on topics covered in these units.  To prepare
for this section,  review your homework and class notes for all discussion questions. (The
exam questions will not be identical to discussion questions, but they will cover the
same material. In this section you will not be asked to discuss specific primary sources,
but knowledge derived from primary sources may still be relevant to your answers.) You
will write a paragraph addressing each question. In this section, you will not be asked to
provide dates, but you will need to know the sequence of events.
\subsubsection{Passage analyses of previously covered sources  (2 questions of 25 points each)}
qYou will identify and analyze two passages from the primary sources we read in these
units. The format will be very similar to the passage analyses on the midyear exam and
on the Unit 7 test. For each passage, you will answer short identification questions based
on the primary source charts and write a paragraph answering an analytical question.
Note that the short questions may include dates. (It is always fine to give an approximate
date, such as mid-2nd century BCE.)
\subsubsection{Passage analysis of an unseen source (1 question - 20 points)}
   For the unseen passage, you will write a paragraph answering an analytical question.
   The format will be similar to the unseen passage on the midyear exam
\subsection{Review process}
  \subsubsection{Before you start your review, collect all materials and organize them by unit}
  Check for any that are missing, especially class notes from days you were absent.
  Check Drive to be sure that you use all unit materials and Toolbox instruction sheets. \\
  \textbf{Note} This should all be here.
  \subsubsection{Use what you know about the exam format to help you structure your review}
  Give yourself review tasks that match what you will be asked to do on the exam.
  \subsubsection{Make conscious decisions about your time allocation; don’t let it just happen}
  Start early, and take breaks when you feel yourself becoming less productive.
  Remember that multiple review sessions will give you better retention than one
  mammoth session. (Memory researchers have said that studying the same material in
  different places - for instance, different rooms in your house - will also boost your
  retention.) Estimate how much time you need for a given task, such as reviewing the
  discussion questions for a single assignment. Test your estimates as you go, and
  reallocate your time as needed.
  \subsubsection{Keep your review active, and quiz yourself as you go}
  Do not simply reread or “go over” your notes.  Passive review strategies prepare you to
  recognize the correct answer (as you would on a multiple choice test), not to produce it.
  For more on the benefits of active review strategies, look at the Toolbox handouts by
  Daniel Willingham and Benedict Carey. \\
  \textbf{Note} This means don't just study off this guide.
  \subsubsection{Remember that all review materials are up on Drive in the “Final Review” folder}
  \subsubsection{Review procedures}
    \subparagraph{Review your discussion question notes}
    As a first step, consolidate your homework and class notes for each discussion
    question. (This is especially important if you did not take class notes on the same page
    as homework notes). You may wish to download unit assignment sheets and type in
    your notes. \\
    Once you have done that, organize your notes as thoughtfully as you can. Remember
    that for review bullet points tend to work better than sentences. What are your main
    points/key phrases? What are your supporting details? What is the relation between
    different questions for the same assignment? How about different assignments in the
    same unit? Return to the textbook for clarification if you need to, but do not simply
    reread assignments.  (That’s likely to lead you into the “fluency illusion”!) \\
    \textbf{Quiz yourself}
    For this step, many students find flashcards useful. Put the question on
    one side and the main points of your answer on the other side. See how many of your
    key points you can remember and how you would explain their relation to each other.
    You are more likely to remember material you reviewed thoughtfully.  (As Daniel
    Willingham says: “Memory is the residue of thought.”) \\
    \textbf{Note}
    This is all very helpful as supplementary review for this guide.
    \paragraph{Review your primary source charts and marginal notes}
    For the passages, follow the instructions on the “Reviewing Primary Sources” handout
    in Toolbox. Start with your primary source charts. Complete any that are missing, and
    give some thought to how you would identify each source and avoid confusing it with
    any similar sources. Be sure that as you review you look back at the unit assignment
    sheets as well as your class notes. Often the discussion questions will give you key
    terms as well as reminding you why we read this source and what was important about
    it. Finally, remember that passage analysis questions ask you to use both the text itself
    and your knowledge of its context. Think about which textbook or secondary source
    assignments provide meaningful context for each text.
    \paragraph{A note on group study}
    Many students enjoy doing some of their studying with a friend or a small group. This
    can work well as long as you do it right. Most important: be sure that each of you
    studies the material individually before you get together to quiz each other.
  \subsubsection{And finally...}
  It’s easiest to review by sections, but on the exam itself you will want to put all your
  knowledge together.  For instance, even if a passage you reviewed does not appear on
  the exam, your memory of it may help you with a short answer or an unseen passage.
  Look back at the Toolbox handout “Writing Essays on Tests and Exams” for more tips
  about what to do during the exam itself.  \\
  Ms. Budding will accept emailed review questions through Saturday June 2. Ms. Budding
  will answer these questions – most often by telling you which readings to look at - in a
  group email Sunday morning.  That’s it. Give the review your best shot, but don’t get too
  worried about the whole enterprise.   And don’t go short on sleep: being alert is likely to
  help you more than knowing a little more material.  Good luck!
\section{Primary Souce Review}
\subsection*{Arrian, \textit{Alexander the Great}}
\subsubsection*{Primary Source Chart}
There was no primary source chart distributed for Arrian's \textit{Alexander the Great}.
\subsubsection*{Assignment 6A.6}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Why did Alexander have Bessus executed, and why did he have him mutilated first?
  \item Why does Arrian criticize Alexander’s treatment of Bessus? (Consider both Arrian’s background and perspective, and Alexander’s actions.)
  \item What were the reasons for Cleitus’s death? What does it suggest about relations between Alexander and his court at this time?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Assignment 6B.3}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What significance did the custom of proskynesis have for Persians?
  \item How did the Greeks and Macedonians interpret proskynesis? (Consider the arguments made by Callisthenes.)
  \item What can we surmise about Alexander’s motives for attempting to introduce proskynesis?
  \item According to Arrian, why did Alexander choose to march across the Gedrosia desert? What hardships did the troops encounter in crossing it?
  \item What character traits did Alexander show during the march? How did the march affect his relationship with his soldiers, as far as you can tell?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Assignment 6B.4}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Who was involved in the Susa wedding (as bride grooms and as brides)? What do you think Alexander hoped to achieve through the Susa weddings?
  \item Why did the soldiers mutiny at Opis? Considering both the soldiers’ actions and Alexander’s response, how would you compare this mutiny with the Hyphasis mutiny? Focus on Alexander’s relations with his soldiers.
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Assignment 6B.6}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Some biographers have seen in Alexander’s actions at this period proof of mental imbalance (paranoia or megalomania). How would you use the text to support or counter this view?
  \item What does Arrian’s evaluation of Alexander tell us about Alexander?
  \item What does Arrian’s evaluation of Alexander tell us about Arrian?
\end{enumerate}

7.2, 7 Handouts Hellenistic \\
\textbf{Content}
A non-Greek (perhaps Arab) worker who took care of camels in Ptolemaic Egypt complains that he has been treated unfairly because he cannot “act the Hellene” or perhaps “speak Greek.”  (The original word could mean one or both.)  Note that the people referred to in the text (Zenon himself, Krotos, and Jason) all have Greek names. \\

7.3, 7 Handouts Hellenistic \\
\textbf{Content}
Livy lists Antiochus IV’s “gifts to cities and worship of gods." \\
\textbf{Dates}
The events took place during 175-64 BCE (the reign of Antiochus IV).  The source was written in the late first century BCE./first century CE. \\
\textbf{Context}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Rome’s power in the eastern Mediterranean was growing in the mid-2nd century, and Antiochus had been a hostage in Rome.
  \item Giving major gifts to cities and building temples were typical activities for Hellenistic rulers.

\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Polybius on Antiochus IV}
\textbf{Genre}
History \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
7.3, 7 Handouts Hellenistic \\
\textbf{Content}
In the first paragraph, Polybius describes various unusual (for a king) actions of Antiochus IV. \\
In the second paragraph, he describes how a Roman magistrate, Popilius, forced Antiochus to end his war with Ptolemy and withdraw his troops from Egypt. \\
\textbf{Dates}
The events took place during 175-64 BCE (the reign of Antiochus IV), with the intervention of Popilius happening in 168 BCE. The source is roughly contemporary.  \\
\textbf{Context}
Rome’s power in the eastern Mediterranean was growing in the mid-2nd century, and Antiochus had been a hostage in Rome. \\
\textbf{Author}

\textbf{Purpose}
Polybius glorifies Rome. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item What do the selections from Polybius suggest about Rome’s position in the Mediterranean world at this time, and about Antiochus IV’s relationship with and attitudes toward Rome and Romans?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{First Maccabees, Chapters 1 and 2}
\textbf{Genre}
Scripture (religious text). \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
7.4, 7 Handouts Hellenistic \\
\textbf{Content}
The author recounts Antiochus IV hellenization of Judea, whether voluntary or involuntary.
This includes disrespecting Judaism by forcing the inhabitants to conform to a pagan religion.
Then the story of Mattathias and his sons is recounted, where they revolt against Antiochus IV.
Mattathias also kills a Jew who was conforming to Antiochus IV's decrees. \\
\textbf{Dates}
\begin{itemize}
  \item First Maccabees as a whole describes events between 166 (when the revolt began) and 135 BCE.
  \item Historians have deduced that it was written between 135 and 63 BCE.  It must have been written after 135 BCE (because it mentions events of that date), but before 63 BCE, when the Romans conquered Judea (because the Romans are described favorably).
\end{itemize}
\textbf{Context}
At the time of the revolt, Judea was part of the Seleucid kingdom ruled by Antiochus IV (r. 175-64). The revolt was ultimately successful:  under the Hasmoneans (descendants of the Maccabees), Judea won autonomy from the Seleucids in 147 BCE. \\
\textbf{Author}
We have no external knowledge about this author. From evidence internal to the source, scholars say:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item the source was probably originally written in Hebrew (shown by Hebrew idioms), though preserved only in Greek translation.
  \item The author was probably a Jew living in Judea. (He knows the geography of Palestine well, but knows little of foreign countries.)  The author admires the Hasmonean dynasty (who were descendants of Judah Maccabeus).  Some have speculated that he was a Hasmonean court historian.
\end{enumerate}
\textbf{Purpose}
The source was written for an audience of Jews living in Judea (that is, not in the diaspora).  It emphasizes that God chose the Hasmonean family to save Israel, and it may have been written to glorify the Hasmonean kings. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item First Maccabees describes Antiochus IV’s attempt to repress the practice of Judaism in Judea. This represented a drastic departure from general Seleucid religious policy, and specifically from the policies pursued by Antiochus IV’s father, Antiochus III. What are some possible reasons for Antiochus IV’s actions?
  \item According to First Maccabees, what were some of the features of Hellenization in Judea?
  \item Who supported Hellenization, and why?
  \item According to First Maccabees, whom did Mattathias and his sons attack, and why?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Unit 8 (Roman Society)}
\subsubsection*{Inscription from Puteoli/L’annee epigraphique}
\textbf{Genre}
Official regulations \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
8.4, \textit{The Roman World}, 26-27. \\
\textbf{Content}
[from the editor’s introduction]: “It describes the regulations that governed the conduct of funerals, which were normally carried out by professional undertakers, who could also be hired to torture or execute slaves, either by order of a court or at their owner’s request.” \\
\textbf{Dates}
Probably the first century CE. \\
\textbf{Context}
Rome had an abundant supply of slaves from their rapidly expanding empire. This allowed
extreme brutality towards those slaves, as there would always be more to replace them.
However, slaves becomming free was very common. \\
\textbf{Author}
Municipal government of Puteoli. \\
\textbf{Purpose}
To establish regulations about how punishments should be carried out, whether they are
flogging, hanging, etc. \\
\textbf{Quote} \\
"Then to the contractor or to his partner, as often as anyone shall throw out [a corpse unburied(?)],
he shall pay a fine of sixty sesterces per body, and the magistrate shall enforce judgement
for recovery of this sum in accordance with the law of the colony."
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using this source, what can you deduce about the treatment of slaves in Roman society?
  \item What else can you deduce?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{The Twelve Tables}
\textbf{Genre}
Laws \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
8.5, \textit{The Roman World}, 4-9 \\
\textbf{Content}
The Twelve Tables consist of laws from the early republican period.  Note that the tables themselves have not survived, even in a damaged form.  Scholars have attempted to reproduce them by using parts of laws that were quoted in later cases.  Many parts are missing, and sometimes the meaning and/or correct order of fragments is unclear. \\
\textbf{Dates}
According to later Roman tradition, the Twelve Tables were written down around 450 BCE. \\
\textbf{Context}
According to later Roman tradition, the Twelve Tables were written down as a result of the “Struggle of the Orders” (conflict between patricians and plebeians). \\
\textbf{Author}
According to later Roman tradition, ten patrician men were appointed to write down the laws. \\
\textbf{Purpose}
The laws were written to regulate conflicts typical of the early republic (and, more broadly, typical of many agrarian societies). \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using the Twelve Tables, what can you deduce about the powers and limitations of the Roman state?  (What actions did individuals perform that a government agency would perform today?)
  \item What can you deduce about traditional Roman values and beliefs?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{Plutarch, Life of Cato the Elder}
\textbf{Genre}
Biography \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
8.6, \textit{The Roman World}, 9-13 \\
\textbf{Content}
This gives an overview of Cato's life, and his values and beliefs. These include his opinions
on slaves, foreigners, how should family work, and other matters.\\
\textbf{Dates}
Written in about 100 CE, about events from 234 BCE - 149 BCE \\
\textbf{Context}
Rome expanded rapidly during Cato’s lifetime, bringing more exposure to foreigners and foreign customs. \\
\textbf{Author}
Plutarch, the author was a priest and sometimes a lecturer, who wrote as a historian. He was
ethnically Greek, but recieved Roman citizenship. \\
\textbf{Purpose}
Plutarch used Cato to illustrate old Roman virtues. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Using this source, make a list of traditional Roman virtues. Indicate the passage that supports each point.
  \item Using this source, make a list of things an “old Roman” like Cato might view with suspicion. Again, indicate the passage that supports each point.
  \item Using this source, what can you add to your previous deductions about the treatment of slaves?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Unit 9 (The Late Republic)}
\subsubsection*{Handbook on Campaigning for Office}
\textbf{Genre}
Non-fiction; manual of advice. \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
9.3 \textit{Roman World}, 107-114 \\
\textbf{Content}
Quintus writes to his brother Marcus about how to campaign for office. Quintus explains that
because Marcus is a new man, he will need to be very precise about how he campaigns.
Quintus emphasizes that Marcus should make a great deal of friendships and allies. \\
\textbf{Dates}
The source was written to be used in Cicero’s campaign for the consulship in 63 BCE. \\
\textbf{Context}
The republic was unstable, with optimates and populares competing politically, and warlords accumulating power. Cicero presented himself as an optimatus (defending the interests of the Senate and the “best” people). \\
\textbf{Author}
This is usually attributed to Quintus Cicero, but it could be forged. \\
\textbf{Purpose}
Written by Quintus Cicero to help his brother’s political campaign. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item As the editor explains, in Roman politics the term “new man” was applied to someone who was the first in his family to become a consul. According to Quintus, how should Cicero take his “new man” status into account in campaigning for the consulship?
  \item What methods does Quintus recommend for mobilizing support?
  \item What is the point of having a “large crowd” accompany the candidate to the Forum (p. 114)?
\end{enumerate}
\subsection*{Unit 10 (Origins of Christianity)}
\subsubsection*{Letters between Pliny and Trajan}
\textbf{Genre}
Official letters \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
10.2, \textit{The Roman World}, 224-26 \\
\textbf{Content}
Pliny writes a letter to Trajan, asking about how Christians ought to be treated. There are a
few specific questions he asks, pertaining to whether they admit to being Christian, and if so,
when the do so. Trajan emphasizes in his response that it is unnecessary for Christians to be
hunted out, but they should be reprocussed unless then repent.\\
\textbf{Dates}
Around 111/112 CE (for both events and letters) \\
\textbf{Context}
Rome is very wary of Christianity at this time, as it is the worship of Christ, a Roman outlaw.
They also fear the nighttime meetings, and some suspect that cannibalism is involved in Christianity. \\
\textbf{Author}
From the editor’s notes on Pliny (for an earlier source): “Gaius Plinius Caecilius Secundus, nephew and adopted son of Pliny the Elder...was born at Comum (now Como), in northern Italy, about AD 61.  He had a long and distinguished career as a lawyer and public servant, culminating in his appointment as governor of the province of Bithynia-Pontus (in what is now northern Turkey) in about 111-12” (Roman World, p. 58). \\
\textbf{Purpose}
Pliny wrote this letter in order to recieve guidance from his superior, Trajan. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item How did the political and cultural frameworks of the first-century Mediterranean world make it easier for Christianity to spread?
  \item How would you summarize Paul’s background and activities?
  \item How did Paul influence the development of early Christianity?
  \item As far as you can tell from the textbook and from the exchange between Pliny and Trajan, how did Roman officials think of Christians? What aspects of early Christianity made them suspicious?
\end{enumerate}
\subsubsection*{The Gospel According to Matthew, Chapter 5}
\textbf{Genre}
Religious text \\
\textbf{Location of Source}
10.3, Handout (also on Drive) \\
\textbf{Content}
The author sets out a narrative of Jesus’ preaching on one occasion, focusing on the Law. \\
\textbf{Dates}
c. 30 C.E. (approximate year of Jesus’ death). Written: c. 80-85 C.E. \\
\textbf{Context}
Be aware of currents within first-century Judaism, including varied interpretations of what the Law requires (especially Pharisee and Sadducee approaches) and apocalyptic thinking. \\
Note that the Gospel of Matthew is considered by many scholars to be the most “Jewish” of the Gospels. To quote religious scholar Bart Ehrman, “This Gospel is distinguished by its stress both on the Jewish-ness of Jesus and on his opposition to Judaism as he found it…[Jesus] gathered Jewish disciples and taught them that they had to follow the Jewish Law. At the same time, Jesus opposed the Jewish teachers of his day and condemned the way they practiced their religion.” \\
\textbf{Author}
The author is anonymous. (“Matthew” refers to a disciple of Jesus but this attribution came later, in the second century.) Internal evidence indicates that the author was an educated, Greek-speaking Christian writing about fifty years after Christ’s death, recording and editing traditions about Christ. \\
\textbf{Purpose}
The source was designed to explain the author’s understanding of Jesus’ teachings and to win converts. \\
\\
\textbf{Discussion questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Based on Chapter 5 of Matthew, how would you describe the relation between the teachings of Jesus and the Law of Moses?
\end{enumerate}
\end{document}
